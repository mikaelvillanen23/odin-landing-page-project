# odin-landing-page-project

The assignment was to create a landing page from scratch by reproducing a provided reference picture as closely as reasonably possible. Also some color and style information was provided. The focus was to make use of everything I have learned about HTML and CSS so far during the Foundations course.

Thoughts after deciding to call it a project and move on:

It was a great challenge! I got pretty close in a certain zoom setting on Chrome (80%) on a Macbook Air M4 15" when the browser window was shrunk to half of the screen (see comparison below). I initially disregarded the given font-sizes but did use them for reference on scaling things. Afterwards I realized that it's not worth resizing everything to match the original, so I just let it be the way it was.

The end result comparison:
My version on the left, original on the right.
